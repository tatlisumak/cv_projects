# Binary Classificaton
The goal of this project is to predict an employee's probability of leaving the company with given circumstances via machine learning algorithms. 
The target variable is the 'Attrition' which is a binary variable with the values 1 or 0. 
It shows whether the employee is currently working or had leaved the company. 
The data that I used for this application is prepared by IBM data-scientists to show how machine learning can be helpful in the neglected area of HR (human relations) analytics.
